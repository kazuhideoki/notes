# CLAUDE.md for Learning/ Directory

Directory for learning materials, technical notes, and references.

## File Organization

- Files should be organized by topic
- Use descriptive file names in snake_case (e.g., `network_learning_notes.md`, `computation.md`)
- Include a `## Links` section below the title with references to related documents and daily notes where the learning was referenced
- Use clear heading structures to organize complex topics

## Content Guidelines

- Focus on technical accuracy and clarity
- Include code examples, commands, and practical applications
- Organize information with appropriate headings and subheadings
- Use code blocks with language specification for syntax highlighting
- Include diagrams or images when helpful (stored in `i/` subdirectory)
- Reference original sources and materials

## Learning Process Documentation

- Document the learning process, not just the end result
- Include challenges encountered and how they were overcome
- Note questions that arose during learning and their answers
- Track progress over time by linking to daily notes where learning occurred

## Cross-referencing

- When learning new material that's documented in daily notes, consider extracting it to a dedicated file in this directory
- When referencing learning materials in daily notes, add links to the relevant Learning directory file
- Create connections between related learning topics through the Links section
