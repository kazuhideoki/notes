## File Organization

- Group related files together where possible
- Include a `## Links` section below the title with references to related documents and daily notes

## Content Guidelines

- For meeting notes, include date, participants, and key discussion points
- For comparisons or analyses, use tables and structured formats
- For personal documents, use appropriate privacy considerations
- Include context about why the file was created and its purpose

## Cross-referencing

- Consider if content might be better organized in a more specific directory as it develops
- If multiple related files accumulate on a single topic, consider creating a new top-level directory
