# CLAUDE.md for Idea/ Directory

Directory for capturing ideas, concepts, and creative thoughts.

## File Organization

- Use descriptive file names in snake_case that capture the core concept (e.g., `information_management.md`, `app_concept.md`)
- Keep one idea per file for clarity and easy reference
- Include a `## Links` section below the title with references to related documents and daily notes where the idea originated or was developed

## Content Guidelines

- Capture ideas completely but concisely
- Include context about when and why the idea occurred
- Document potential applications or implementations
- Note related ideas or concepts that might connect
- Include diagrams or sketches when helpful (stored in `i/` subdirectory)

## Typical File Structure

## Idea Development Process

- Initial capture: Record raw ideas quickly in daily notes to avoid losing them
- Extraction: Move developed ideas from daily notes to dedicated Idea files
- Refinement: Revisit ideas periodically to expand and refine them
- Connection: Link related ideas together to build concept networks

## Cross-referencing

- When new ideas appear in daily notes, add a task to extract them to the Idea directory if they seem valuable
- When referencing ideas in daily notes or other documents, add links to the relevant Idea directory file
- Create connections between related ideas through the Links section
